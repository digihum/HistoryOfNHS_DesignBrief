# HistoryOfNHS_DesignBrief
Detailed design brief for the project "The History of The NHS".

## Introduction
The project is a collaboration between the University of Warwick, Wellcome Trust, and the Centre for the History of Medicine, and Digital Humanities (DH) team acted as the web design and developer unit for this project. The focal point for this project is the history of the NHS, and the community around it. The idea is to have a space where the researchers can publish objects related to NHS's history i.e. Virtual NHS Museum, a People's Encyclopaedia, and a space where visitors can interact, to discuss about NHS and its related topics.
